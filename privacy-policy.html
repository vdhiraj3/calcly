<h1>Privacy Policy — Calcly</h1>
<p>Last updated: <strong>26 sept 2025 01:00pm</strong></p>

<p>Calcly (the “Site”, “we”, “us”) provides free online calculator tools. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can control it.</p>

<h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automatically collected:</strong> We collect basic technical data (IP address, browser type, device type, pages visited, session timestamps) through server logs and analytics tools to operate and improve the Site.</li>
  <li><strong>User-provided:</strong> If you contact us (via email or contact form) we collect the information you provide (name, email, message) to respond.</li>
  <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Calculator history stored in your browser (localStorage) remains on your device unless you clear it. We do not collect personal calculator inputs on our servers by default.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
<p>We use cookies and local storage to remember preferences, store calculator history locally, and to improve performance. Third-party services (for example Google Analytics) may set cookies when you visit the Site.</p>

<h2>3. How we use information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To operate, maintain and improve the Site and its tools.</li>
  <li>To respond to user inquiries.</li>
  <li>To analyze aggregate usage patterns (via analytics) so we can improve features and performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
<p>We may use third-party services such as Google Analytics and advertising networks (for example Google AdSense). These services have their own privacy policies—check them directly. We do not share personal data with third parties except as required to provide the services (for example ad networks may collect non-identifying usage data).</p>

<h2>5. Ads</h2>
<p>If we display ads (AdSense or similar), these ads are served by third parties and may use cookies and device identifiers to show relevant ads. We do not control the tracking practices of these ad providers.</p>

<h2>6. Your choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can clear local calculator history via your browser settings or the tool’s "Clear" button.</li>
  <li>You can opt out of analytics cookies using your browser settings or third-party opt-out tools (for example Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on).</li>
  <li>To request data removal or ask questions, contact: <strong>infocalcly@gmail.com</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Children</h2>
<p>Our Site is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will remove it.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the "Last updated" date at the top when changes are made.</p>
